# Task 3: Heart Disease Prediction

## Objective:
To build a machine learning classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data.

## Dataset Used:
- Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle:
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

## Process:
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values and correlations
- Converted categorical variables to numeric using One-Hot Encoding
- Applied feature scaling
- Built a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated model with accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve

## Key Results:
- Logistic Regression model achieved good accuracy and ROC AUC Score
- Most important features identified through model coefficients

## Skills Applied:
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- Logistic Regression modeling
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
- Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
